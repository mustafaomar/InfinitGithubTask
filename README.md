## AnalyzeRepoLetterFrequency Method

### Summary
Performs a comprehensive analysis of the letter frequency in JavaScript and TypeScript files within the specified GitHub repository. The method executes several steps: fetching the latest commit's SHA, retrieving the repository tree, checking the GitHub API rate limit to ensure the feasibility of the operation, analyzing the letter frequency in `.js` and `.ts` files, and finally displaying the results.

### Steps
1. **Initialize GitHub Client**: Set up the GitHub client with necessary credentials.
2. **Fetch Repository Tree**: Retrieve the tree structure of the repository based on the latest commit.
3. **Rate Limit Check**: Ensure that the GitHub API's rate limit is sufficient to process all the JavaScript and TypeScript files in the repository. Throws an exception if the rate limit is insufficient.
4. **Letter Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the frequency of each letter in the contents of `.js` and `.ts` files.
5. **Display Results**: Sort and display the letter frequency analysis results in descending order.

### Exceptions
- Throws a `System.Exception` if the GitHub API rate limit is not sufficient to process all target files.
